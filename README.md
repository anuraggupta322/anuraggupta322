## 🚀 About Me
I’m a **Backend Engineer (4+ years)** specializing in:

- **High-scale distributed systems**
- **Microservices architecture**
- **Spring Boot ecosystems**
- **Real-time data pipelines & ingestion systems**
- **System design & scalable backend engineering**

I’ve built **chatbot frameworks**, **multi-platform social data harvesters**, and **high-throughput backend services** used by **major enterprise clients like AXIS Bank & BOB Bank**.

My work involves building systems that are:
✔ Fast  
✔ Reliable  
✔ Scalable  
✔ Cleanly designed  
✔ Easy to maintain  

I love solving complex engineering problems and designing systems that perform at scale.
